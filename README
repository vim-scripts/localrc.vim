You can put a configuration file for the files below the certain directory.

The configuration file is a Vim script of a decided file name like .vimrc.
The file name is specified by |g:localrc_filename|.

Configuration file applied only to a specific filetype can be put.  The file
name is specified by |g:localrc_filetype|.

When two or more configuration files exist, it is sequentially loaded from a
shallow hierarchy.
For example:
	~/
	|- .local.vimrc		(1)
	`- project/
	   |- .local.vimrc	(2)
	   `- src/
	      |- .local.vimrc	(3)
	      `- main.c
In this case, when main.c is loaded, the configuration files are loaded in order
of the number.
